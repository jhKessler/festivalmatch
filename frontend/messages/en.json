  "FAQ": {
    "Question1": "How does Festivalmatch find the right festivals for me?",
    "Answer1": "In order to find the best festivals for you, I give each festival in my festival database a match score based on your favorite artists and songs and the artists performing at the festival. The higher the score, the better the festival suits your musical taste!",
    "Question2": "How does Festivalmatch use my Spotify account to recommend festivals?",
    "Answer2": "This is how it works: After you log in with your Spotify account, Spotify allows me to query your favorite artists and songs via the WebAPI. After one hour, this access expires and I cannot request any further data from Spotify .",
    "Question3": "Can I get festival tips without having a Spotify account?",
    "Answer3": "No, unfortunately that's not possible yet. I am currently working on supporting Apple Music and allowing you to enter your favorite artists manually."
